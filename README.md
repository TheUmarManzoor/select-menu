## Description

This project showcases how to create a custom select menu that provides a more interactive and visually appealing alternative to the default HTML `<select>` element. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve the following:

- Displays a default text ("Select social media") with a down arrow icon.
- Opens a dropdown menu when the user clicks on the select field.
- Allows the user to choose from a list of social media options (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter).
- Updates the selected text and closes the dropdown when an option is clicked.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-select-menu.git
   cd custom-select-menu
